// i renamed 31-37AD to 37-50AD, 74MTS to 74MST and 58MTS to 58MST, as they were named 
// wrongfully, and some old crafts you maybe download have the parts saved as the old
// name, these patches clone the parts and hide them, to load crafts with the old
//part names, so TL;DR Part Compability Patch for renamed parts.w

//Lisias did tell me this, and he provided some patches to fix it.
